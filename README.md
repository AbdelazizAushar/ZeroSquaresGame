# Zero Squares Game

## Overview
Zero Squares is a Java-based puzzle game where the player navigates colored squares on a grid to reach their designated goal positions. The game implements multiple AI algorithms to automatically solve the levels and compare their efficiency. This project demonstrates the use of search algorithms, heuristics, and state management in a grid-based environment.

## Features
- Grid-based puzzle with movable colored squares.
- Single-player gameplay with multiple squares to control.
- Multiple AI algorithms for solving levels:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Recursive DFS (RDFS)
  - Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
  - Simple Hill Climbing
  - Steepest Hill Climbing
  - A* Search
- Logging and performance measurement (visited states, execution time, memory usage).
- Supports multiple pre-defined levels.

## AI Solving
Each algorithm explores the possible moves from the current state until it reaches the goal:
- **BFS**: Explores all states level by level.
- **DFS**: Explores as deep as possible along each path before backtracking.
- **RDFS**: Recursive implementation of DFS.
- **UCS**: Explores states with the lowest cumulative cost first.
- **Simple Hill Climbing**: Moves to the first better neighbor state.
- **Steepest Hill Climbing**: Moves to the neighbor state with the best heuristic.
- **A\***: Uses heuristic + cost to explore the most promising states first.
